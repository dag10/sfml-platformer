SFML Platformer

Description:

   A simple library in development to serve as a framework for making 2D side-scrolling games using the cross-platform SFML multimedia library.
   This project also includes a simple game with no true purpose as a demonstration of the library. Well actually, it's for testing it.
   Or rather, the library is this default "game", but is easily customizable. It's all a work in progress and is unfinished.
   I am currently not working on it either. If you use it at all, learn from it, or make changes to it, I'd *love* to hear about it!

Compiling (LINUX):

   First, go here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/start-linux.php
   Go to the section "Compiling SFML (for advanced users)", and make sure you have all packages required installed.
   As the site suggests, you can run 'sudo apt-get build-dep libsfml'.
   Then make sure you install the package libsfml-dev by running 'sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev'.
   Finally, run 'compile_linux.sh'. It is an incredibly crude "make script" I created. I'm terrible at making makefiles.

Compiling (WINDOWS):

   For windows development, I use Code::Blocks. I suggest you do the same.
   To compile this code on Windows using Code::Blocks, create a new bare C++ project in Code::Blocks,
   add the source and header files in 'src' and 'include', and then follow the instructions here:
   http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/start-cb.php

   Note: I temporarily changed all file paths in the code (such as "resources/level_01.bmp") from
   "resources\\level_01.bmp" to "resources/level_01.bmp" so that it could run on Unix-based systems.
   To get the program to run on Windows, you may need to change this back.
   To see an example of what I'm talking about, look at some of the changes near the bottom of this diff:

Compiling (OSX):

   For compiling on OSX I use Xcode 4. Just use the included Xcode project to get you started.
   The Xcode project has two targets/schemes: Client and Server.
   However, unless you have the SFML framework installed in /Library/Frameworks, you will need to
   edit the targets to include the necessary libraries.

Final Notes:

   Again, I apologize for the incredibly un-helpful readme and makefile. I'm very new to the use and creation of makefiles. If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me. I tend to read all received emails within 10 minutes :P
