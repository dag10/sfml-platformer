SFML Platformer

Description:

   A simple cross-platform 2D side-scrolling multiplayer platform game.

Compiling (LINUX):

   !!! TEMPORARILY BROKEN - WORKING ON A NEW MAKEFILE FOR CLIENT AND SERVER TARGETS !!!
   
   First, go here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/start-linux.php
   Go to the section "Compiling SFML (for advanced users)", and make sure you have all packages required installed.
   As the site suggests, you can run 'sudo apt-get build-dep libsfml'.
   Then make sure you install the package libsfml-dev by running 'sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev'.
   Finally, run 'compile_linux.sh'. It is an incredibly crude "make script" I created. I'm terrible at making makefiles.

Compiling (WINDOWS):

   !!! SHOULD BE 
   For windows development, I use Code::Blocks. I suggest you do the same.
   I included two Code::Blocks project files (.cbp) for both the Client and the Server (Platformer_Client.cbp and Platformer_Server.cbp respectively).
   Please go into "Settings > Compiler and debugger... > Toolchain executables" and set the Compiler's installation directory to where MinGW is installed.
   Please use the latest MinGW version. Go here to download an installer for the latest MinGW version:
   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20110530/mingw-get-inst-20110530.exe?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmingw%2Ffiles%2F&ts=1308354552&use_mirror=cdnetworks-us-2
   Please make sure to select something along the lines of "Most recent version/revision" when installing.

Compiling (OSX):

   For compiling on OSX I use Xcode 4. Just use the included Xcode project to get you started.
   The Xcode project has two targets/schemes: Client and Server.
   However, unless you have the SFML framework installed in /Library/Frameworks, you will need to
   edit the targets to include the necessary libraries.

Final Notes:

   Again, I apologize for the incredibly un-helpful readme and makefile. I'm very new to the use and creation of makefiles. If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me. I tend to read all received emails within 10 minutes :P
