SFML Platformer

Description:

A simple library in development to serve as a framework for making 2D side-scrolling games using the cross-platform SFML multimedia library.
This project also includes a simple game with no true purpose as a demonstration of the library. Well actually, it's for testing it.
Or rather, the library is this default "game", but is easily customizable. It's all a work in progress and is unfinished.
I am currently not working on it either. If you use it at all, learn from it, or make changes to it, I'd *love* to hear about it!
